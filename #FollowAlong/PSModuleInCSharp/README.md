# Creating your first PowerShell module in C#

* Emanuel Palm
* Justin Grote

## Synopsis

Do you sometimes wish that you could access things just a little bit deeper in the .NET stack?
That you could use more of the published .NET SDKs and packages as PowerShell commands?
That your modules would run a little bit faster?

Sometimes you encounter scenarios where you might need a little more Power in your PowerShell module,
so in this follow-along session we'll take a look at situations where authoring modules in C# really shines.

You will follow along using Visual Studio Code and Github Codespaces to checkout the project, build, and test the pre-written examples.
Once you get a feel for it, you will be able to test your skills by attempting the labs and passing the pre-written
Pester tests.

In this session you will learn: 
* How a C# class forms the basis of a PowerShell cmdlet 
* The similarities to an advanced function such as the Cmdlet attributes, begin, process, and end steps.
* The different ways you can target a module for different PowerShell platforms, and even see an example written in F#!

**Prerequisites**

Please follow [the setup guide](https://github.com/PalmEmanuel/YourFirstPSModuleInCSharp#follow-along-setup) *before the session begins* for the best experience, we will not have time to provide catch-up for those who did not follow the setup guide (it is very short).
